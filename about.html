                <h1>What</h1>
                <p>Geekwise Academy is an accelerated training program for current and aspiring
                technologists. Geekwise Academy teaches trainees hard skills in the technology 
                industry in only six weeks. Each course is fast-paced, rigorous, and narrowly 
                focused on a hard skill that is presently in-demand in the technology industry.</p>
                
            <!-----------How-------------->
                <h1>How</h1>
                <p>The subject matter for each course is selected by an employer who wants to recruit 
                technologists right out of the Geekwise Academy classroom. Geekwise Academy then works
                with the employer to build a curriculum specifically designed to effectively teach that
                skill. Each course is then taught by an industry-expert lecturer. Every second of every
                course is designed to provide you with the skills that technology employers and clients
                need you to have.</p>
            </div>
            <!-----------Why-------------->
            <div class='right'>
                <h1>Why</h1>
                <p>We need more geeks. Lots of them. And good ones. It’s no secret that software
                and information technology are among the fastest growing industries on the planet.
                Despite that truth, there simply aren’t enough technologists to keep up with the 
                demand. Not to mention that these industries offer promising careers and have mountains
                of jobs that are available today. Geekwise Academy exists to fill that demand by rapidly
                producing high quality technologists, and then connecting those same technologists to
                real world opportunities.</p>
